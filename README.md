# Login-Signup Window

This is a simple **Login and Signup user interface** made using **HTML and CSS**.

## Features
- Responsive login form
- Signup form
- Styled using CSS
- Works in any modern browser

## Files
- `index.html` → Login page
- `signup.html` → Signup page
- `style.css` → Styles for both pages

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser to see the login page.
2. Open `signup.html` in a browser to see the signup page.
3. CSS is already linked, so the design will load automatically.

## Notes
- This project is purely **frontend**, no backend logic.
- Can be used as a starting point for larger projects.
